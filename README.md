### Coding practices

- [Formatting: PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- [Naming: PEP8 ish](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)
- Version control for this project, public at the moment (happy to make it private)
- Code Formatting should be automatic before commit
- Object Oriented Programming 
- Program has been designed with unit/integration testing in mind, aiming for modularity


I took a MILP approach.
I set all market time steps to the smaller period (0.5 hours for this particual exercise).
See below constraints and objective function.
Battery tends to charge using market 1 (lower prices) and discharge in Market 2.
If not battery degradation, it tends to cycle very quickly.
I added linear battery degradation penalty which reduces the number of cycles taking advantage of higher prices and ensuring a longer life of the battery.
Calendric degradation doesn't seem to have much effect.
Iâ€™m concerned that it never goes to the daily market.
Increasing artificially the price shows that the daily market constraints work (constant power during the whole day). 
Potentially a charging/discharging ramp constraint might also force the optimization to go into the daily market.

Asumptions:

a) Fixed cost not factored in cost function
b) The full period of simulation needs to be a day expressed in hours and integers if there is a daily market (i.e. no 2.3 days)
c) Battery degradation has been linearised and it's been added as a linear penalty in the cost function, proportional to CAPEX-lifetime cycles ratio


Program is encapsulated into 2 classes.

The two classes are:
- `Battery` takes the market data and it stores battery parameters and solution from optimization.
- `Market` stores prices for those markets

## Observations

I made sure that the number of cycles calculated were reasonable. I can calculate the maximum number of cycles and then I can add up the actual number of cycles from the solution plus the idle time.
As stated above market 2 prices are generally higher so battery uses it for charging while discharging in market 1.

A bit worried that battery doesn't go into market 3. I've increased the prices of market 3 x10 and then I can see the constraints are working fine. I might be missing something here.
Perhaps the degradation penalty should force to slower charge/discharge cycles.
Calendric degradation doesn't have much effect so that's another source of error to check.

### TODO

Loads to do but I'm well over the 2-3 hours timeframe given. Just over 4 hours now.

- [ ]  fall back strategies:
	- [ ] Do post-process before plot to avoid error
	- [ ] full queue, slow down producer threads
- [ ] Error/warning logging and exception handling
- [ ] Increase abstraction of classes and modularity ie declare variables, constraints and objective function in separate methods.
- [ ] Solution is slow, there is a lot of potential to reduce the number of variables as daily market has the same number of associated variables as the intraday markets.
- [ ] Non-linear approach to battery degradation, using bilinear or [piecewise]https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261919320471 tricks seen in the literature.
